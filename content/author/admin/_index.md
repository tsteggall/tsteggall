My name is Tim Steggall and I'm an analyst and project manager with 5 years of experience working in both sports and politics. With the Rays I coordinated and streamlined the day-to-day operations of the scouting department, and I’m proud to have been part of three successful drafts from 2015 – 2017. In 2018, I moved to California and managed the successful State Assembly campaign for Rebecca Bauer-Kahan.

I plan to use this blog to dive into the R community, continue to develop my technical skills, and showcase my work and thought-process. 

Outside of the blog/work, I like to run, read, and hang out with my dog. If you have thoughts, questions, ideas, or just general inquiries, please feel free to shoot me an email at <tsteggall@gmail.com>.
