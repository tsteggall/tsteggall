I'm an analyst and project manager with 5 years of experience working at the intersection of data analysis and decision making, with a successful track record in both professional sports and politics. 

With the Tampa Bay Rays, I lived the "Moneyball" experience â€“ I was part analyst, scout, coordinator, and project manager, with the primary responsibility of overseeing and optimizing amateur scouting operations. I left the Rays in January 2018, moved to California, and managed the State Assembly campaign for Rebecca Bauer-Kahan. Despite starting with a steep name recognition deficit, we built a $1.5m campaign from the ground up and successfully unseated a two-term incumbent.  

I'm currently living in San Francisco and looking to continue leveraging my skillset to tackle challenging and interesting problems. I plan to use this blog to dive into the R community, continue to develop my technical skills, and showcase my work and thought-process. 

If you have thoughts, questions, ideas, or just general inquiries, please feel free to shoot me an email at <tsteggall@gmail.com>.
