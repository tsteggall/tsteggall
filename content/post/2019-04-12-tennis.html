<p>This week I wanted to use the TidyTuesday project as an opportunity to put together a Shiny app. I don’t follow tennis particularly closely, but I do try to watch highlights of the Grand Slams, so I have some familiarity with the data. I began the analysis with the idea of identifying the “Andy Murrays” of the world - “Second Line” players that had less illustrious careers due to the dominance of the top ranked players. My Shiny app sort of succeeds in this regard - it is easy to identify the top players by time frame, but I wouldn’t say it draws explicit attention to any one particular player. That task falls on the user.</p>
<p>To compare players and put them on the same scale I added <strong>2019 ATP scores</strong> to the data set for the player’s finishing position as explained in this <a href="https://ftw.usatoday.com/2018/08/atp-wta-tennis-rankings-how-do-they-work-faq-federer-serena-nadal">USA Today article</a>. The ATP has used this ranking system since 2009, but I applied it to the entire dataset. This scale probably doesn’t account for differences between eras, but I think it’s a solid starting point for ranking the players against each other.</p>
<p>Also, I didn’t do much data cleaning because I was focused on the Shiny app. After watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWUCUfEeNJI">David Robinson’s video</a> I probably should have focused on that a tiny bit more, so take any conclusions with a grain of salt.</p>

<h3>Takeaways</h3>
<ul>
<li>I knew Novak Djokovic was good, but didn’t realize he was quite clearly the best men’s tennis player (based on Grand Slams) from 2010-2019 with almost 10,000 more ATP points earned than Nadal, and 20,000 more points than Federer in that time period.<br />
</li>
<li>Federer’s peak period was 2003-2010, when he won 16 of 32 Grand Slams, and earned 20,000 more points than the next closest male competitor (Nadal).</li>
<li>Serena Williams has dominated women’s tennis for almost 2 decades! Venus had slightly more ATP points from 2000-2005, and there’s a brief window (2004-2008) where Justine Henin is arguably the best women’s tennis player, but after that Serena laps the field. Henin also doesn’t play in as many Grand Slams starting in 2008.</li>
<li>Steffi Graf must have been unbelievable - she was one of the most efficient players ever, winning 22 Grand Slams in 66 chances, giving her nearly as many ATP points as Evert, Serena, and Navratilova despite playing in at least 10 less Slams.<br />
</li>
<li>Based on this scale, Chris Evert has an argument as the best professional tennis player ever, male or female. She has the most ATP points earned in Grand Slam events with 69,060, and she did it relatively efficiently having only played in 76 total tournaments.</li>
</ul>

<p>As mentioned above, I didn’t do much actual cleaning of the data, but I did create a new column with the correct number of ATP points for a given tournament outcome.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>grand_slam_timeline &lt;- grand_slam_timeline %&gt;%

  filter(outcome != &quot;Retired&quot;)
